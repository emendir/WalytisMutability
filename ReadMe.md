# Walytis Mutability

A Walytis blockchain overlay featuring block mutability.

## Features

- mutability: blocks can be edited or deleted on the abstracted overlay blockchain
- block history: old versions of blocks and deleted blocks will always be retrievable
- compatibility: can be combined with WalytisOffchain to use its encryption & authentication

## Project Status **EXPERIMENTAL**

This library is very early in its development.

The API of this library IS LIKELY TO CHANGE in the near future!
